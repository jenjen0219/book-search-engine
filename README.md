# Book Search Engine- GraphQL API

## Description
This is a GraphQL API for a book search engine that allows users to search for books, save them to their account, and manage their saved books. The API is built using Apollo Server that was restructured from an existing Google Books API search engine with a RESTful API. 

<br>
There is still a lot for me left to learn about GraphQL and RESTful APIâ€™s. Although we were replacing RESTful api's, I still aim to further understand the concept to complete the bigger picture of the needs that GraphQL services.
